# CS2 Lan Helper
This is a desktop application designed to allow you to create Counter-Strike 2 servers with ease for tournaments, LAN parties, or whatever else!

## Important Info
SteamCMD currrently does not allow you to download a CS2 dedicated server client. You must provide Steam credentials to download the game client and then run it in `-dedicated` mode. You can create a new steam account to do this.

This application is a work in progress and most features will probably not work until an official release!
